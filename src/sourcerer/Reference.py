Germline reference output

The airrflow artifact for a germline source is not a samplesheet: it is a
reference tree that IgBLAST and Change-O read. This module is to the reference
sources what Airrflow.py is to the dataset sources -- the one place that knows
the shape of the output nf-core/airrflow expects, kept out of the sources
themselves so a second reference source inherits it unchanged.

This module holds the builders that turn downloaded germline FASTAs into the two
directory layouts airrflow consumes: a reference_base of per-chain FASTAs, and --
only when asked, because it needs the BLAST+ binary -- an igblast_base of BLAST
databases plus the internal_data and optional_file trees mirrored from NCBI. The
base class germline sources extend, ReferenceSource, lives in
sourcerer.Sources.Germline, kept there rather than here so this module never
imports from sourcerer.Sources and the two stay free of an import cycle.

The reference_base keeps the source's own FASTA verbatim, gaps and all, exactly
as airrflow's bin/fetch_references.sh leaves it. Cleaning (gap removal, dedup)
happens only when the BLAST database is built, so nothing that reads the
reference for its IMGT numbering, such as Change-O's germline reconstruction,
loses it.
