NCBI cross-reference

Some OAS studies do not record a Subject in their own metadata (`sourcerer oas
download` passes that through raw, as the OAS null sentinel 'no', rather than
guessing — see Airrflow.buildSamplesheet). Every such run still has an SRA run
accession or GEO sample accession embedded in its OAS unit id, and that
accession usually names the sample plainly somewhere on NCBI, e.g. BioSample
SAMN36877371 for run SRR25557617 gives the sample name 'BL-110_VDJ'.

This module is the deterministic half of closing that gap: given a batch of
accessions, resolve each one's sample name plus a link a person can open to
check the record themselves. An SRR/ERR/DRR run resolves through its
BioSample; a GSM resolves through GEO's own record too, and preferably so --
see resolveGsmTitles for why a GSM's SRA/BioSample text is not trustworthy
enough to rely on alone. Either way, this does not decide what part of that
raw text is the subject's identity — 'BL-110_VDJ' strips to BL-110 in one
study while 'TT04_subj6_V3' strips to TT04_subj6 in another, and telling
those apart needs to know the specific study's naming convention, not just
read the string. suggestSubject applies the handful of patterns generic
enough to be safe across studies; everything else is left for
`sourcerer oas verify`'s evidence report to surface for a human to decide.
